# WhamTest
An early stage testing interface. Easy to use, with dedicated interfaces, using Wasp.
Sorry for the poor markdown formatting you are about to see, it's not my strong suit.

To install and run the app, you will need to install the Wasp CLI. If you do not already have curl installed, you need it as well.
curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh
Next, run git clone https://github.com/uniAIDevs/WhamTest
After cloning is complete, 
cd WhamTest
wasp db migrate-dev
wasp start

You may need to downgrade specific dependencies. Codespace instant install coming soon!
